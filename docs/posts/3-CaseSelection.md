Quite often, I like to start my projects with a case selection. Since I have
quite a few hardware projects under my belt, I also have a fair idea of how much
space things are going to take. Despite this, in reality, I sort-of overlap the
selection of case with the selection of the largest components; in this case,
power supplies. I will cover power supplies in a future blog post; suffice it to
say that I determined 200 mm of case depth would suffice.

Based on that, I wanted a 19" 1U rack case with a depth of 200-250mm. The width
and height were fully determined by the 1U factor, while the depth was selected
as not to interfere with other components. For power supply health, I also
wanted to have some cooling slots.

Representative of a cheap case was [AliExpress Lang Lang](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806730934183.html)
coming in at only $32. It's made of aluminium, has slots, and gets offered in
depths of 200mm (1), 250mm (4), and 300mm (3). However, the specification is a
bit unclear as to the rear panel. One picture makes it seem as though it's
predrilled, but on another, it seems to be one-piece. I find this case to be as
close as it gets match to my requirements.

Even cheaper variant is [AliExpress Tokban](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806681086534.html)
at $28. It has no slots, but that's not an issue since drilling aluminium is not
an issue. And it already has power supply input cutout, so that's a bonus. On
the negative side, its dimensions seem to be higher than 1U would allow. There
is a high possibility this is just a typo. Also, considering I need 2 AC inputs,
I'm missing a second cutout.

All other cases I found on AliExpress were just a variant of these two.

My other source is always [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/rack-components/599?s=N4IgjCBcpgHAzFUBjKAzAhgGwM4FMAaEAeygG0R4AmATitlhAF0iAHAFyhAGV2AnAJYA7AOYgAvuKIA2JCAEATLgFowABghtOkECCIBHdgE8umkMdZ4uGHKklA)
and I started my search by filtering on basic case properties.

The cheapest case I found comes at $34 in form of [Bud Industries PRM-14460](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bud-industries/PRM-14460/655427).
This one is 200 mm deep and already has some mounting options inside. I am not
as worried about structural stability since it will sit on top of UPS, but
structural supports inside do fragment the internal space a bit.

Another interesting case is [Hammond RM1U1908VBK](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/hammond-manufacturing/RM1U1908VBK/2094741),
but I try not to even look at it too hard due to its high price of $158. Yes, it's
built better than any other case in this list, but the premium cost doesn't
justify it for this project. That said, for some other projects, this might be
a really nice option, so I'm placing it as an alternative here.

At this time, I am leaning toward a plastic option with [Bud Industries PRM-14460](https://www.budind.com/product/general-use-boxes/plastic-rack-mount-box-series/prm-14460/)
since plastic seems the most promising material to mount an OLED screen. If
mounting stuff inside proves to be much of a challenge, my backup option is [AliExpress Lang Lang](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806730934183.html)
since it allows for more freedom when it comes to mounting and it also has a
deeper 250mm option.
